# AI-Platform-Square-HB

AI-Platform-Square-HB is the starting point for a platform-style project. This repository currently focuses on defining a clear, scalable architecture and documentation baseline so implementation work can move quickly once services are added.

## Repository structure

```
.
├── docs
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   └── README.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
└── README.md
```

## Getting started

1. Review the architectural decisions in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
2. Follow contribution guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
3. Add service code following the directory conventions described in `docs/README.md`.

## Documentation

- Architecture overview: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Documentation index: `docs/README.md`
- Contribution guide: `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Roadmap

- Introduce service modules aligned with the architecture document.
- Add environment setup scripts once concrete runtime requirements are known.
- Expand testing and CI guidance as implementation grows.
